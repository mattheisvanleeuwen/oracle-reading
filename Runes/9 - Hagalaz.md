### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**9\. Hagalaz (ᚺ) — The Principle of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Hail."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Hagalaz is the rune of sudden, disruptive, and fated change. It is the "hailstorm" from the cosmos—an external crisis you did not cause and cannot control. It represents destruction, disruption, and the shattering of old forms. Its purpose is to force radical change, break stagnation, and reveal the essential structure within.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☳ Thunder):** As the *Principle* (Pos. 1\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is *fated, external crisis*. When this rune flavors the **Thunder** trigram, the "Arousing" is not a willed action. It is a *sudden, chaotic shock from outside*—a "hailstorm" that shatters the situation and forces an awakening.
