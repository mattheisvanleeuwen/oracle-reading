### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**14\. Perthro (ᛈ) — The Inner Light of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** Unknown. Often "Lot-Cup," "Fate."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Perthro is the rune of mystery, fate, synchronicity, and the hidden. It is the "lot-cup" from which destiny is cast. It represents the *Wyrd* (fate) that is not yet revealed, the forces of the unconscious, and the "aha\!" moment of paradoxical insight. It is the hidden, the secret, and the occult.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☲ Fire):** As the *Inner Light* (Pos. 6\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is the *hidden light of fate*. When this rune flavors the **Fire** trigram, the "Clarity" (Lí) is not rational knowledge. It is the *sudden, paradoxical insight of synchronicity*. It is the "flash of lightning" that reveals a hidden secret or the working of fate.
