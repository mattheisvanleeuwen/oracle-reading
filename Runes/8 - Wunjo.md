### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**8\. Wunjo (ᚹ) — The Culmination of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Joy."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Wunjo is the rune of joy, harmony, and communal fellowship. It is the feeling of belonging to the clan, the "wish" fulfilled, and the resultant harmony. It represents social success, emotional bliss, and the alignment of the individual will with the community. It is the "happy ending" that results from right action.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☱ Lake):** As the *Culmination* (Pos. 8\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is *communal harmony*. When this rune flavors the **Lake** trigram, the "Joy" (Duí) is specifically *social joy*. It is the pleasure of the group, the shared celebration, and the harmony of the "clan" or team.
