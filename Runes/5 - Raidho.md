### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**5\. Raidho (ᚱ) — The Journey of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Riding," "Journey."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Raidho is the rune of directed movement, process, and cosmic order. It is the "right action" and "right timing" of a journey. It represents travel, but also the moral or ethical "path" one follows. It implies that you are in control of your journey, following a structured plan, and that the process itself is as important as the destination.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☵ Water):** As the *Journey* (Pos. 5\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is a *controlled, worldly journey*. When this rune flavors the **Water** trigram, the "Abyss" is not a chaotic, dangerous flood. It is a *structured, necessary process*—a "river" flowing between defined banks. The danger (Kǎn) is part of a known path, like a controlled descent.
