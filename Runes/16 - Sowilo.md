### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**16\. Sowilo (ᛊ) — The Culmination of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Sun."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Sowilo is the rune of victory, illumination, and the indivisible power of the will. It is the sun's energy, which brings life, clarity, and success. It represents the realization of the true self, the "soul's" purpose. It is a moment of total clarity, confidence, and positive, victorious energy. It is the light that banishes all shadow.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☱ Lake):** As the *Culmination* (Pos. 8\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is *individual illumination and victory*. When this rune flavors the **Lake** trigram, the "Joy" (Duí) is not social. It is the *inner, radiant joy of the realized Self*—the deep, personal satisfaction of success and self-knowledge.
