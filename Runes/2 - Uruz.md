### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**2\. Uruz (ᚢ) — The Substance of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Aurochs" (a wild ox).  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Uruz is the rune of primal, untamed strength, endurance, and raw, unformed potential. It is the vital life force, robust health, and the resilience to survive. It represents the "stuff" of reality before it has been shaped by will. It signifies a test of strength or a need to draw on your deepest, most instinctual reserves of power.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☷ Earth):** As the *Substance* (Pos. 2\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is *primal, formless matter*. When this rune flavors the **Earth** trigram, the "Receptive" is not weak or passive. It is the receptivity of a *deep, powerful, resilient foundation*. It is the fertile, untamed field that can withstand any hardship and contains the potential for all growth.
