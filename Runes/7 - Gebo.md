### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**7\. Gebo (ᚷ) — The Connection of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Gift."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Gebo is the rune of exchange, partnership, and generosity. It represents the sacred, binding contract of a gift, which demands a gift in return. It governs all relationships: love, business, and divine. It is the point of connection where two separate entities meet and create a balanced, reciprocal bond. It is the only rune that cannot be reversed, signifying that all exchange, even difficult, is a form of balance.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☴ Wind):** As the *Connection* (Pos. 7\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is *human-to-human exchange*. When this rune flavors the **Wind** trigram, the "Gentle Penetration" (Xùn) is specifically that of *social influence, relationship, and communication*. The "wind" is the breath of a conversation, the influence of a partner, or the power of a network.
