### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**18\. Berkano (ᛒ) — The Substance of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Birch."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Berkano is the rune of the "Birch Mother," representing birth, new beginnings, nurturing, and fertile growth. It is a gentle, protective, and generative rune. It signifies a new project, a literal birth, or the need to nurture an idea (or yourself) with gentle care. It is the "womb" of becoming.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☷ Earth):** As the *Substance* (Pos. 2\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is the *spiritual womb of becoming*. When this rune flavors the **Earth** trigram, the "Receptivity" is *actively fertile and nurturing*. It is the "Mother" aspect of Earth, which does not just endure (Uruz) or suffer (Nauthiz), but *gently and actively gestates* new life.
