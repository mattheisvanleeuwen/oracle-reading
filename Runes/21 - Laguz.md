### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**21\. Laguz (ᛚ) — The Journey of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Water," "Lake."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Laguz is the rune of the "water" of the unconscious, intuition, and emotional flow. It is the deep, collective unconscious, the "river of life." It represents emotions, dreams, and the psychic, intuitive abilities. It is a rune of "going with the flow" and trusting the inner voice, even when the path is not rational.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☵ Water):** As the *Journey* (Pos. 5\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is the *journey through the unconscious*. When this rune flavors the **Water** trigram, the "Abyss" is not an external danger. It is the *deep, emotional, and intuitive flow* of the collective unconscious. The "danger" is losing oneself in emotion, but the *path* is intuition.
