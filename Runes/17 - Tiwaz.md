### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**17\. Tiwaz (ᛏ) — The Principle of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "The God Tyr."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Tiwaz is the rune of divine justice, spiritual law, principle, and self-sacrifice. It is Tyr, who sacrificed his hand to bind the wolf of chaos. It represents the victory of order over chaos *through* principle. It calls for courage, integrity, and the willingness to make a personal sacrifice for the greater good or for what is right.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☳ Thunder):** As the *Principle* (Pos. 1\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is *divine, principled action*. When this rune flavors the **Thunder** trigram, the "Arousing" is a *conscious, willed, and self-sacrificial act*. It is the "bang" of the judge's gavel, an action taken from a place of deep moral principle.
