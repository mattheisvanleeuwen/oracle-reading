### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**6\. Kenaz (ᚲ) — The Inner Light of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Torch" (or "Ulcer").  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Kenaz is the rune of human-wielded fire: knowledge, skill, craft, and creativity. It is the torch in the dark, the light of analysis and consciousness that illuminates the unknown. It represents the ability to shape reality through *applied skill*. It signals a time for clarity, study, and the skilled expression of an idea.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☲ Fire):** As the *Inner Light* (Pos. 6\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is *human skill and applied knowledge*. When this rune flavors the **Fire** trigram, the "Clarity" (Lí) is not the passive light of the sun. It is the *active torch of the craftsman* or the academic. It is the clarity that comes from *skillful analysis* and conscious, creative work.
