### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**12\. Jera (ᛃ) — The Order of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Year," "Harvest."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Jera is the rune of the natural cycle, process, and fated time. It represents the "right season" for an action and its inevitable consequence (the harvest). It is the cosmic law of "as you sow, so shall you reap." It speaks of patience, as all things come to fruition in their own time. It is the spiral of cause and effect.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☰ Heaven):** As the *Order* (Pos. 4\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is *natural, cosmic law*. When this rune flavors the **Heaven** trigram, the "Creative" force is not an individual's will. It is the *impersonal, vast, unfolding cycle of fate* or karma. It is the "dragon" of time itself, the inevitable power of the turning seasons.
