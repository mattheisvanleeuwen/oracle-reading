### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**11\. Isa (ᛁ) — The Threshold of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Ice."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Isa is the rune of absolute stasis, stillness, and frozen form. It is the cosmic winter, a complete blockage of all activity. It represents a time of total, non-action, where plans are frozen and the will is thwarted. Its wisdom is in surrender, turning inward, and consolidating energy. It is the "I" of the ego, which must become still.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☶ Mountain):** As the *Threshold* (Pos. 3\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is *absolute, fated stillness*. When this rune flavors the **Mountain** trigram, the "Stillness" is not a choice. It is a *total, frozen blockage*. The "mountain" is a wall of ice, imposing a complete stop to all external movement and forcing a period of internal contemplation.
