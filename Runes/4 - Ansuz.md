### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**4\. Ansuz (ᚫ) — The Order of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "God" (specifically one of the Æsir), "Estuary."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Ansuz is the rune of divine inspiration, consciousness, and communication. It is the *Logos*, the power of the word, and the "breath of Odin." It relates to poetry, intellect, reason, and the passing of sacred knowledge. It signals a time to speak, listen, and learn, as inspired messages are available.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☰ Heaven):** As the *Order* (Pos. 4\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is *divine consciousness made manifest*. When this rune flavors the **Heaven** trigram, the "Creative" force is specifically that of *intellect, idea, and the power of the word*. The situation is driven by a powerful, generative idea, a strategic plan, or a command that must be spoken.
