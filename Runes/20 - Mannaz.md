### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**20\. Mannaz (ᛗ) — The Order of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Man," "Human."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Mannaz is the rune of the perfected human, the realized Self, and social consciousness. It represents the divine spark *within* humanity. It is the rune of intellect, self-awareness, psychology, and the human social order. It calls for self-reflection and an understanding of one's place in the human collective.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☰ Heaven):** As the *Order* (Pos. 4\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is *perfected human consciousness*. When this rune flavors the **Heaven** trigram, the "Creative" force is the *power of the human Self*. It is the "dragon" as the visionary leader, the psychologist, or the sage—the power of the divine *as expressed through* human intellect and self-awareness.
