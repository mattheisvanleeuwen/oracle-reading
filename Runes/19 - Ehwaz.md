### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**19\. Ehwaz (ᛖ) — The Threshold of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Horse."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Ehwaz is the rune of partnership, trust, and the vehicle of movement. It is the "two horses" (Ehwaz) pulling a chariot, representing a loyal partnership or team. It signifies movement, progress, and change, but *in tandem* with another. It requires trust, loyalty, and a balanced duality to move forward.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☶ Mountain):** As the *Threshold* (Pos. 3\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is the *potential for movement*. When this rune flavors the **Mountain** trigram, the "Stillness" is not a blockage. It is the "horse in the stable," a *potential for movement that is currently at rest*. The "mountain" is a *pause*, not a barrier, and it will be overcome through partnership or finding the right "vehicle."
