### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**13\. Eihwaz (ᛇ) — The Journey of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Yew Tree."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Eihwaz is the rune of the life-death axis, initiation, and the "underworld journey." The yew tree is poison and long-lived, connecting all realms. This rune represents a profound trial, a "dark night of the soul," which is necessary for transformation. It is the rune of the shaman, who travels the *axis mundi* to gain wisdom through adversity.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☵ Water):** As the *Journey* (Pos. 5\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is the *initiatory, shamanic journey*. When this rune flavors the **Water** trigram, the "Abyss" is not just a danger. It is the *underworld*—a profound, dark, and transformative trial that is necessary for spiritual rebirth.
