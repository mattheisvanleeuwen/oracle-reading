### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**24\. Othala (ᛟ) — The Culmination of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Heritage," "Ancestral Land."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Othala is the rune of ancestral legacy, inheritance, and the established home. It represents the "home" as a sacred space, but also the "spiritual DNA" passed down from your ancestors. It is about tradition, family, and the legacy you both inherit and create. It can also signify a separation from what is old to claim your true inheritance.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☱ Lake):** As the *Culmination* (Pos. 8\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is the *spiritual inheritance and legacy*. When this rune flavors the **Lake** trigram, the "Joy" (Duí) is the *profound, collective joy of the ancestral line*. It is the pleasure of "home," the security of heritage, and the established harmony of your legacy.
