### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**1\. Fehu (ᚠ) — The Principle of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Cattle," "Wealth."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Fehu is the rune of primal, creative potential and material abundance. It represents new beginnings, generative energy, and the resources (wealth, health, or data) needed for a project. It is the spark of action, the "moveable wealth" that must be circulated to have value. It warns against greed or stagnation, urging you to be a good steward of your energy and possessions.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☳ Thunder):** As the *Principle* (Pos. 1\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is the *catalyst of substance*. When this rune flavors the **Thunder** trigram, the "Arousing" is not a random shock. It is an *action rooted in material potential*. The situation is being "aroused" by a new resource, a financial opportunity, or a powerful store of latent physical energy that is now ready to be *used*.
