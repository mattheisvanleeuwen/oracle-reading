### **Aett 1: Freyr's Aett (The Realm of Manifestation)**

**3\. Thurisaz (ᚦ) — The Threshold of Matter**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Giant" (Old Norse: *þurs*), "Thorn."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Thurisaz is the rune of the gate, the threshold, and the directed, catalytic force of breakthrough. It can be a protective barrier (a thorn) or a destructive force (a giant). It represents the power to act or the power to defend. It often signifies a conflict or a difficult choice at a gateway that must be consciously faced before you can proceed.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☶ Mountain):** As the *Threshold* (Pos. 3\) of *Manifestation* (Aett 1), this is a *physical or external barrier*. When this rune flavors the **Mountain** trigram, the "Stillness" is not a peaceful meditation. It is the stillness of a *guarded gate* or a defensive posture. It implies a blockage that must be consciously acknowledged and potentially forced open.
