### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**10\. Nauthiz (ᚾ) — The Substance of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Need," "Distress."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Nauthiz is the rune of necessity, constraint, and the friction of fate. It is the "need-fire," generated by rubbing two sticks together—the fire of survival. It represents the hardships, limitations, and internal struggles we must endure. Its wisdom is in using this resistance to build inner strength, a "fire of will," and to discern what is truly necessary.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☷ Earth):** As the *Substance* (Pos. 2\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is *the friction of fated constraint*. When this rune flavors the **Earth** trigram, the "Receptive" is *under duress*. It is the endurance of hardship, the "biting the bullet" of necessity. It is the ground hardened by drought, which must still endure.
