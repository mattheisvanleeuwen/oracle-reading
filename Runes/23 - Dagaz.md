### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**23\. Dagaz (ᛞ) — The Connection of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Day."  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Dagaz is the rune of breakthrough, enlightenment, and radical transformation. It is the "dawn," the twilight moment between night and day where all things are possible. It represents a "satori" or flash of enlightenment that changes your entire perspective. It is a total paradox, a moment of awakening that is not a process, but a sudden shift.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☴ Wind):** As the *Connection* (Pos. 7\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is the *breakthrough of cosmic consciousness*. When this rune flavors the **Wind** trigram, the "Gentle Penetration" (Xùn) is not a social influence (Gebo) or a whisper (Algiz). It is a *sudden, total flash of enlightenment*—a "wind" that is a "divine breath" that transforms you instantly.
