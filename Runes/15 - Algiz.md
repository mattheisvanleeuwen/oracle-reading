### **Aett 2: Heimdall's Aett (The Realm of Ordeal)**

**15\. Algiz (ᛉ) — The Connection of Ordeal**

* **Literal Meaning:** "Elk" (or "Protection").  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Algiz is the rune of divine protection and connection to the higher self. It is the "elk-sedge" that cuts, or the shape of a person with arms upraised to the gods. It represents the *valkyrja*, the protective spiritual force. It is a "higher consciousness," a shield, and a link to the divine that warns of danger.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☴ Wind):** As the *Connection* (Pos. 7\) of *Ordeal* (Aett 2), this is the *connection to the divine*. When this rune flavors the **Wind** trigram, the "Gentle Penetration" (Xùn) is the *whisper of the higher self* or the "still, small voice" of intuition. It is a spiritual, protective influence, not a human one.
