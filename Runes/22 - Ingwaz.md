### **Aett 3: Tyr's Aett (The Realm of Spirit)**

**22\. Ingwaz (ᛜ) — The Inner Light of Spirit**

* **Literal Meaning:** "The God Ing" (another name for Freyr).  
* **Oracle Interpretation:** Ingwaz is the rune of gestation, inner potential, and the "seed" of creation. It is a "light" that is gestating "under the earth," a potential that is locked away, building power before it bursts forth. It signifies a time of internal development, withdrawal, and the completion of a phase, just before a new one begins.  
* **Interpretive Lens (for ☲ Fire):** As the *Inner Light* (Pos. 6\) of *Spirit* (Aett 3), this is the *gestating seed of divine potential*. When this rune flavors the **Fire** trigram, the "Clarity" (Lí) is *internal and potential*. It is not a torch (Kenaz) or a secret (Perthro), but the *light of a seed*. The "fire" is a period of internal gestation and self-contained potential.
