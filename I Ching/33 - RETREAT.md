# CHAPTER 33: **RETREAT**

The brillance of the moon begins to diminish at the moment it reaches its fullness, while winter's coming becomes apparent even in the summer. This natural pattern of advance and decline is reflected now in human affairs. Just as life prepares its enduring retreat from the dark stillness of winter, you must prepare to RETREAT from a rising darkness that will work at cross purposes to your aims.

Like winter, this hostile and inferior force is in accordance with the patterns in the cosmos. To RETREAT at the proper moment is the best course of action. Choose this moment wisely. If you RETREAT too soon, you will not have time to properly prepare your return; if you wait too long, you may be trapped. Your RETREAT should be confident and powerful. You are not abandoning the situation, but, instead, making a wise and timely withdrawal. Until the time is right for a countermove, only small things may be accomplished successfully. Modest but firm arrangements should be made both to aid in your return and to prevent any adversaries from advancing in your absence.

It is of great importance that you do not confront or struggle with opposing forces and thereby become emotionally involved with what is, actually, a futile situation. Vengeance and hatred will cloud your judgment and prevent the necessary RETREAT. You cannot win the war right now, but you can stop the enemy's advance. This is done with a determined detachment: Cut off the lines of communication, become self-sufficient, withdraw intellectually and emotionally.

Difficulties and hostilities are on the rise in matters of business or politics. Do not attempt to compete with these forces. Instead, concern yourself with small internal reinforcements. The overall situation is inflexible at this time, yet a detached RETREA T will give you the opportunity for later advancement.

•In your relationships, you may have to RETREA T en masse from the forces around you. If discord exists between you and your loved one, it is best to look upon it as a phase in the development of the relationship. Try to become composed and dispassionate. Your ideals cannot be met within the relationship at this time. Instead, RETRE4T and look inward for satisfaction.

You may now be suffering from an inner conflict based upon the misalignment of your ideals and reality. If such is the case, it is time to RETREAT and take a longer look. Do not abandon your principles, but do withdraw from situations and attitudes that create conflict. Continuing in inner conflict will result in stress that is unhealthy for both mind and body.
