# CHAPTER 45: **ASSEMBLING**

The ASSEMBLING of a group is the basis of this situation. The members of the group unite because of shared bonds or goals. This assemblage can be a reunion of people with a common heritage, such as a family or religious congregation, or an artificial structure such as society, business, or politics.

The major key to understanding and acting harmoniously with this time lies in the contemplation of the center. In every gathering there is a leader and/or common goal. Whether you are this leader or whether you are one of several striving for the attainment of a goal, your commitment to this assemblage is now of vast importance for both your own personal well-being and that of the group.

During the time of ASSEMBLING every member of the enclave must maintain unity and ensure that a sympathetic bond exists throughout. Disharmony among members and factions that form out of divergent goals will undermine the group. Strong bonds must be maintained and strengthened by adherence to appropriate moral principles, and by constant movement toward ever greater deeds.

In matters of business or group politics, you must be certain that the stated objectives strike you as honorable and that you trust your leaders. At this time you may approach those in authority with success. You must, however, have sincerity and commitment in your heart, as you may be called upon to make a sacrifice for the attainment of the general objective. If you make this sacrifice, it will bring good fortune.

Relationships may be emphasized at this time. You can now readily familiarize yourself with your position socially or within your family. Note the quality of your interactions. Self-observation within a group can speed you toward an expanded awareness. The original Chinese text points out that "by observing the way gatherings evolve, we can perceive the inner tendencies of heaven and earth and of all things."

Within the Self, too, there is a central force of character that unifies thoughts and actions. When you are not in accord with your goals, you may feel indecision, conflict, or malaise; when you are, a sense of confidence and well-being will surround you.
