# CHAPTER 32: **CONTINUING (ENDURING)**

Consider flowering plant: its new leaves stretching open, reaching for the life-giving sun: its roots anchoring deep into the earth, drawing sustenance into itself. As if prompted by an invisible imperative, it forms its blossom and develops its fruit. In time its flower magically unfolds, inviting response to its sensual delights of color and scent. Nature. in turn, participates in pollinating and thereby furthering the development of the wondrous seed hidden within the fruit. Soon, after this co-operative celebration of life, the plant concentrates the total of its energies into the ripening fruit and maturing seed. In the end, as the plant declines and rests, perhaps terminating itself, the seed detaches and falls to the earth, CONTINUING the perpetuating mystery of existence. The Chinese say of this hexagram: "When we examine the continuance of things, the natural tendencies of heaven and earth can be seen. Herein lies the secret of eternity."

The time requires a regard for continuing traditions and enduring values. Look within for character traits that are self-perpetuating and self-renewing. New goals can be reached through relying on that which has endurance and consistency in your nature. Act out the laws of your inner Self, trust the inherent correctness of your instincts as you go about your business. In this way you will meet with success.

Social customs will offer assurances and support because of their very endurance. CONTINUING in traditions that are the understood bases of social interaction will now bring order, unity, and a deep sense of security to you and your community. This does not mean a blind dogmatism to arbitrary social institutions, but rather an adherence to foundations that support the growth of sound and smooth-working systems in life.

In business and political affairs, pay particular attention to the support of policies that have proved themselves useful. This is not the time to change methods of operation for the sake of change. Instead, it is a time to make these methods work with new trends in thought. Success now comes through CONTINUING movement toward long-standing objectives — objectives that are harmonious with a wellordered life.

Personal relationships will now develop most comfortably within the structure of enduring social institutions such as marriage or family. The ceremonies and customs that spring from tradition will bring joy and security into your life. At the same time, your relationships should have direction and should grow and adapt to the times. CONTINUING traditions will create a superstructure for a flowering relationship, as a trellis for a vine. Never should they become rigid limitations.
