# CHAPTER 46: **ADVANCEMENT (PUSHING UPWARD)**

You will experience an ADVANCEMENT in personal power and esteem because of a timely accord of your modest, steady actions with the tendencies of the cosmos. The coming success is tremendous in scope since the foundation it rests upon has been developed with true devotion over a reasonable period of time, and since the time is fortuitous, indeed, for the goals " you have in mind. As it so appropriately states in the Bible about times like these, the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places, yea, I have a goodly heritage."

Take full advantage of your good fortune by using this opportune time to approach those in authority. Do not be apprehensive or intimidated by this. Assertive and confident contact with those above you will meet with successful response. Furthermore, do not pause in the efforts you have made so far, for continuous activity is necessary to yield the most beneficial results in your ADVANCEMENT. Through the steady force of your will, your luck will remain excellent.

You may expect a promotion or ADVANCEMENT in political or business matters. Because of your past willingness to adapt your energies to the objective at hand, you will now gain benefits, perhaps beyond your expectations. Your superiors will be receptive to your desires, and you will achieve personal recognition.

Such recognition is indicated in social affairs as well. A gain in your social stature is coming, even though it may be unexpected. Join with others in community projects and see them through to completion. You will now instinctively choose endeavors that are harmonious with the rhythms and desires of society, and as a result you will be favorably regarded.

Rather than overshadowing or threatening your personal relationships, your ADVANCEMENT in influence will create a thriving emotional environment. You can now make a genuine breakthrough in communication with those dear to you. If you pursue this actively you will develop even stronger bonds.

All work on the Self is now centered in the will. Know what must be done and carry it out with unwavering effort. Through self-discipline, the foundation of a strong will can now be successfully formed. This will bring both immediate good fortune and long-lasting strength of character.
