# CHAPTER 24: **RETURNING**

You are RETURNING to the beginning of yet another cycle in your life, after what may have seemed a long period of stagnation or frustration. Progress had been halted at every turn, and movement appeared impossible. Now the paths leading to renewed growth are revealing themselves. Although you may be quite anxious to proceed with your plans, you must keep in mind that things are just at their beginnings. Don't push. The improving situation will continue to develop at its own pace. This promising turn for the better is certain, and as natural as the change from a still, cold winter to the early anticipation of spring. And, like the seasons, the cycles in life cannot be hastened. Conserve your energies instead. You'll need them to cope with the inevitable complexities that arise with new phases. The RETURNING situation will establish itself of its own accord. Contemplate and adjust your relationship to this new phase in order to afford yourself a comfortable position within it.

This is a time when groups of like-minded individuals can come together and work toward a common goal. Success is indicated here because the progress of these individuals is unhampered, both in the external world and in their innermost motivations.

You may be experiencing a dormant period in your social life, or perhaps an illness that has held you back. This situation suggests a return to better times, but cautions as well against overly vigorous movement. Just because you feel better now, do not immediately throw yourself into an energetic undertaking or attempt to be the center of the social event of the season. Remember, you must strengthen the beginning with rest.

The time of RETURNING can also indicate a new beginning through a fresh approach to important relationships. If such is the case, treat this time very carefully. You must now be aware of what to expect from relationships that do not start out on the proper footing. Above all, this footing must be relevant to your nature. If you are still uncertain about this, this current phase is an ideal opportunity for selfknowledge. At the time of RETURNING to new beginnings is the implied end of an old cycle. Study the phase you are now exiting. It is a cycle. It had a beginning and you are experiencing its end. The reasons for certain things that may have been unacceptable or confusing to you are now apparent. The contemplation of the return

of these cycles can lead to profound inner knowledge. The Chinese refer to this hexagram as the apparent pattern of the intelligence of Heaven and Earth.
