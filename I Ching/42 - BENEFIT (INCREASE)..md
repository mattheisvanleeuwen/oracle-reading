# CHAPTER 42: **BENEFIT (INCREASE).**

Exceptional energy is being directed into the current situation. Many things will become possible, even very difficult undertakings. It is important to make the best use of your time now, as conditions will change. Pursue your goals on a daily basis and remain persevering. Keep in mind that your immediate goals should serve to BENEFIT your entire milieu in order to attain the successes implied in this hexagram. The kind of energy available can be utilized only on worthwhile endeavors.

If you are a leader, employer, administrator, or other figure of influence in the community, it is a very auspicious time to be generous toward your supporters. You may, in fact, be called upon to make a sacrifice from your personal resources to advance the goals of your followers. Such a gesture can now greatly BENEFIT society. People will be so moved by your actions that they will be irresistibly compelled to loyalty and unity, thus strengthening the commonwealth. The Chinese say of this hexagram: "To rule truly is to serve."

Those engaged in business or political affairs can use this model to BENEFIT their own aims, provided their goals are worthy. The time is ideal for offering especially generous services to others. This will open the way to greater areas of potential development. Generous actions, too, can enhance social, family, and personal relationships.

At this time it is possible that you are looking within, toward the development of your character. Because of the intensity of the benevolent forces surrounding you, you are presented with an excellent opportunity for self-improvement. Whether you would like to break old habits or foster new and useful disciplines, there now exists the proper alignment of forces for beneficial results. This is a particularly fortuitous time to discard a self-indulgent attitude or endeavor in order to gain a certain fundamental goodness, a sound foundation, a sense of direction and well-being. By discarding bad habits you will find you can accommodate improved and progressive patterns. Self-awareness and self-discipline are the keys to this transformation. Observe the beneficial effects of good in others and emulate these useful traits.
