# CHAPTER 17: **ADAPTING (FOLLOWING)**

When autumn approaches. all of life that continues to survive begins an adaptation to the season. The pelts of animals begin to thicken in anticipation of the winter, while the seeds of plants scatter themselves in autumn winds to await the spring. The bark of the tree increases to protect itself from the cold, while insects may burrow deep inside to hibernate. By ADAPTING to the forces, life is protected as it rests and restores itself for new activity.

ADAPTING is knowing when to act and when to rest, when to speak and when to be silent. The nature of this hexagram is compared to the time of autumn when activity ebbs and rest begins. This is not a restraint, for there is no stress involved. It is instead a peaceful, accepting frame of mind willing to adjust to the existing forces. You should now concern yourself with doing the best you possibly can under the circumstances. Leave the control of the situation to others. Even if you feel you possess the strength to alter events, it is in your best interests to remain low. True power lies in serving others, and with such behavior comes progress and success.

In worldly matters, only leaders who adapt their vision to the sentiments of society will be followed. If their ideals are too far from the popular mainstream of reality, if they are not ADAPTING their product or service in the interests of the times, then following them can lead to danger. However, if their goals are harmonious with the times, you may commit yourself to their leadership. When you follow another, you may relax and restore yourself.

Try to be flexible in your social and personal relationships and, if necessary, subordinate yourself. It is correct to adapt to the situation presented now, for this is the only way that there will be favorable progress. Do not waste your energies struggling against the predominant forces. Instead, make your relationships as rewarding as possible by ADAPTING yourself to the current mood.

Rid yourself of old prejudices and opinions that may be controlling your behavior and holding you back. If your goals and principles are not consonant with those of your society, then you must make an adjustment in yourself. Your progress now depends upon the reality of your milieu. You may live by your own rules in your own home, but once outside, you must adapt. By ADAPTING to the realities around you at this time, you will find peace of mind and success.
