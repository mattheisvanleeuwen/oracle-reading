# CHAPTER 7: **COLLECTIVE FORCE (THE ARMY)**

When an object has mass, it is said to have gravity. The denser its mass, the greater the dynamic force of its gravity. Within our own solar system, a large planet like Jupiter attracts with a powerful force nearly three times that of our smaller earth. This forceful law of gravity and masses, effective throughout all the cosmos, is significantly effective among large masses of people as they focus the awesome strength of their COLLECTIVE FORCE.

The time of COLLECTIVE FORCE requires great discipline, organization, and righteous aims. Those in authority must have confidence in you, and you must gain support from the people around you as you continue in your endeavors. This energy of mass support can be tapped now if you are communicating effectively and if your goals are in accordance with the sentiments of society.

Supportiveness and generosity toward others can accomplish the difficult task of uniting the masses. Originally titled The Army, this hexagram points to the necessity of organizing and experiencing this COLLECTIVE FORCE, although it warns against using it for dangerous warlike purposes unless there exists no other alternative. Clearly, a strong leader is required for this task, while the time is especially auspicious for those in positions of authority. People can now be most effectively led through education, generosity, and leniency. At the same time they must be inspired by a noble vision and impressed by firm principles.

Any venture now requires a strong inner conviction of your correctness. You must assume that you are acting with the COLLECTIVE FORCE behind you. If you feel unconnected from your society then you must make it a point to find and experience this powerful resource inherent in humanity. Naturally, this takes exceptional awareness and determination, but the strong man who achieves this will meet with good fortune.

Be generous now and accommodating in your personal relationships. Try to see your roles together in the context of all of humanity. A more philosophical point of view can do wonders at this time, whereas a focus upon the more eccentric aspects of your relationships can lead you astray. Hold together with your loved ones and attempt to overcome any difficulties with the gravity of your COLLECTIVE FORCE. This force is the basis of organization and continuity, whether in a solar system or in a love affair.

Ultimately, in matters of your external relationships you must always return to the center of the Self for orientation and processing. This is a fine time to broaden your ideals to encompass larger goals — the goals of all of mankind. This will eventually strengthen your ability to call upon the COLLECTIVE FORCE in dangerous times. Concurrently, you will also hear the call of this force as it grows, changes, and informs.
