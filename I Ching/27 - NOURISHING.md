# CHAPTER 27: **NOURISHING**

The idea of the hexagram NOURISHING originates from the interdependent structure of the food cycle on earth. All of life is sustained within a self-perpetuating system. An example of this system is the balanced exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen among plants, animals, and earth. At the same time, the quality and quantity of this NOURISHING exchange yields a particular quality and quantity of growth.

The correct NOURISHING of yourself and others is the focus of this time. When your endeavors involve the NOURISHING of others, it is important that they are worthy of such support. If you consistently nourish superior persons, who will in turn provide nourishment for others, you can achieve great effects. Through nurturing and support, social and political aims can meet with success.

In judging another person or situation, the model of NOURISHING is an excellent analytical device. Out of poor habits or erroneous thinking a man may nourish himself in an inferior way. This pattern may be detected by observing his outstanding character traits. If they are inferior traits, then he takes into himself inferior things and will have nothing to offer you. If his character traits are worthy of praise, that which he chooses to ingest is superior and he may have much that is worthwhile to give.

If there are difficulties in your relationship, take note of the quality of what you give to others. Do you offer inspiration or discouragement? Do you focus on what is wrong with particular situations or on what could be right? The correct NOURISHING of those close to you is vital to your sense of well-being, for such supportive activity will ultimately come back to you in kind. This cycle of NOURISHING will have an indirect yet profound impact on your life.

Additionally, you should exercise unrelenting discipline over your thought patterns. Cultivate only productive opinions and attitudes in order to properly nourish your character. If you are engaged in activity at this time, keep your mind as calm and relaxed as possible. Avoid excited and opinionated outbursts; instead, express yourself with moderation. Pay special attention to what you allow to enter your sphere of awareness, and, at the same time, avoid excessive indulgences.
