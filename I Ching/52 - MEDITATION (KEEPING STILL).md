ZhuangZi: Do not be the possessor of fame. Do not be the storehouse of schemes. Do not take over the function of things. Do not be the master of knowledge. Personally realize the infinite to the highest degree and travel in the realm of which there is no sign. Exercise fully what you have received from Nature without any subjective viewpoint. In one word, be absolutely vacuous. The mind bf the perfect man is like a mirror. It does not lean forward or backward in its response to things. It responds to things but conceals nothing of Its own. Therefore it is able to deal with things without injury to its reality.
