# CHAPTER 34: **GREAT POWER**

GREAT POWER. when it befalls a man, is a true test of his character. All of his actions have significant influence upon others. What he says is heard, what he thinks is felt. He has the wherewithal to bring enlightenment and progress to his world or to lead it into chaos and evil. He can greatly further his inner development, or completely exhaust himself. Therefore the man possessing GREAT POWER is mostly concerned with correctness.

Keep in mind that power is a means and not an end in itself, In applying the available forces to the situation at hand, be certain that your timing is exact and that your actions are correct — that is, in the best interest for all concerned. The Chinese point out that actions that combine both correctness and GREAT POWER represent the true character and tendencies in heaven and on earth. The responsibility of correctness in times of GREAT POWER is unparalleled in importance, for actions that are inappropriate or incorrect will pull you and others into chaos.

There is little question that this hexagram is unusually auspicious in worldly matters. Although blessed with GREAT POWER, you would be wise to pause and be certain that your proposed objectives are honorable. Take a cue from the past. Do not do anything that is not part of established policy. Unorthodox actions can lead to downfall during powerful times. Be patient, too, and wait for the opportune moment before executing your plan.

Above all, the influence of GRE4T POWER will be most evident in direct social situations. You will find yourself in the center of attention. Your influence is tremendous at this time; your presence does not go unnoticed. Use the power to improve relations and implement good works. When in doubt, adhere strictly to established customs and social order. In this way you will realize continued support, even after the time of GREAT POWER is past.

You will find that you have unusual influence and power in personal relationships. This is, definitely, a responsibility. Those you love trust you and look to you  for leadership. Sensing their dependence, they may look to you for reassurance as well. Maintain now a strictly traditional role. Even innocent deviations from the traditional could end in emotional disaster.

Transcend difficulties in your inner development by remaining mindful of your shortcomings. Do not assume that your power indicates strength of character, or that it justifies all your attitudes and opinions. This is just another test. Pay special attention to timing, propriety and goodness in order to fully employ the GRE4T POWER available to you. In bringing enlightenment and progress to others, you strengthen your own sense of health and well-being.
