# CHAPTER 31: **ATTRACTION**

The universe as we know it is held together and governed by the various laws of ATTRACTION. From the vast movements of the solar system in infinite space to the perfectly balanced center of the atom, these mutual attractions create all things. In life. these attractions manifest themselves in a complex network of desire, perseverances and fulfillment. Life begets life and evolves itself in an ordered and divine fashion, The ATITRACTION between mates, with an underlying interest toward social unity and, perhaps. progeny, is the emphasis here. This magnetism is not a superficial desire. It is the beginning of the most basic social unit, the family, just as the atom. with the ATTRACTION of its positive and negative charges, is the basic material unit.

This is a serious and profound ATTRACTION that is shared by both you and the object of your interest, whether it is a person or a situation in which you are integrally involved in the outcome. In this situation you happen to be in the position of power. The initiative is yours. For the most successful results, you must subordinate yourself and free your mind of motive and prejudice. Allow the object of your interest to influence and change you. In this way, because of the advantage of your strength, ATTRACTION is reciprocal and the relationship or involvement is consummated.

This describes the way great leaders can influence society. An attitude of servitude demonstrated by the leader toward the people encourages them to approach him for advice and guidance. In this way the leader can direct others into areas of greater development and order.\* In social matters, your willingness to be influenced, even though you may be altogether self-sufficient, attracts others to you and creates an atmosphere for the exchange of ideas. Pertaining to personal relationships, it is unequivocally stated in the original text: "To take a spouse brings good fortune."

If you are attempting at this time to make a decision or judgment concerning another person, pay particular attention to what he attracts. In this way you can penetrate his nature and fate. By examining his energies, ideas and associations, you can begin to see what the nature of your involvement will be. Then you may determine if such an ATTRACTION will benefit you. The same holds true in the judgment of any situation. By penetrating that which the situation attracts — people, problems, and possibilities — you can see the way it will affect your current position, well-being, and future.
