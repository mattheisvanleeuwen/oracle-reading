# CHAPTER 16: **HARMONIZE (ENTHUSIASM)**

All events in nature follow the path of least resistance and harmonious natural order. Rivers cut through the most yielding areas in their downward rush to the oceans. The tides rhythmically undulate to the pull of the moon, while the moon orbits on the tether of the earth's gravity. The earth is held in check on its axis by the sun, and there follow the seasons in fixed regularity. All things in life HARMONIZEwith these laws and patterns, including the myriad affairs of man.

Within society there are fixed traditions, popular opinions, and irresistible sympathies that instinctively spring from the nature of mankind. When you wish to lead, influence, govern, or arouse others, you must first align your values to those held by society. In this way you gain the attention, enthusiasm, and co-operation of others. Prohibitions that run contrary to the sentiment and life-style of people create resentment. Unpopular wars cannot be waged without shattering the public spirit and causing disharmony.

During this time you should seek to analyze the essential nature of the moment. If you can grasp the direction of the tendencies around you, you can parallel them and accomplish great deeds. New ideas, inventions, and innovations can now be successfully developed and promoted. Penetrate the popular sentiment of society, anticipate what will be needed and supported, and choose able helpers who will be enthusiastically attracted to your compelling inspiration.

The Chinese compared this time to the composition of music. The persuasive and mathematical purity of harmony in music inspires the hearts of the listeners ina mass experience. The forceful mystery of this tonal relationship can be demonstrated as an invisible language of our perceptions of reality. The profound experiences of art, education, history, healing, religion, and patriotism are expressed in music. People are inspired, in times of harmonizing, to feelings of universal perfection and truth. So powerful are these moments of perfect harmony that Confucius was prompted to say: "He who could wholly comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were spinning on his hand."

This hexagram suggests that you are now able to HARMONIZE socially and communicate fully your ideas and interests. Your general resonance with the mood of the time should make you particularly charismatic in your personal relationships.

You can now readily put yourself in touch with your true nature in order to further the development of your character. Pay attention to your bodily rhythms, observe your inherent character traits, and listen to your inner voice. Moreover, this state of mind can enhance your health and well-being. You can instill in your body an enthusiasm for life by harmonizing your spirit with the cosmic order.
