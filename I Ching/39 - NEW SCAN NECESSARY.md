together those who can help you, seek advice from appropriate sources, get in touch with your divine nature. If you then follow through with persistence and correctness, you will meet with remarkable progress and success.

In all worldly paths, OBSTACLES appear naturally throughout the course of time. In matters of power and politics, obstructions must be overcome as they arise if you are to continue on your way. The correct approach requires a certain amount of cunning, for you must either organize a following or align yourself with established leadership in order to prepare an assault. In business concerns, now is an excellent time to hire those who can help you. Or perhaps you should consider joining forces with another. Look for qualities of leadership in these people, qualities that can surmount OBSTACLES standing in the way of long-term objectives.

A more conscientious approach to social matters is required now. The ability to be in the right place at the right time has never been more useful.

These struggles will take place within the Self. Often referred to as inhibitions, such OBSTACLES will block your progress. Yet if you focus your awareness on them and persevere in constructive and positive thoughts, you will experience great good fortune as your developing character strengthens and prepares itself.
