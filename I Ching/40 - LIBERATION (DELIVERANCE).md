# CHAPTER 40: **LIBERATION (DELIVERANCE)**

Anxiety and strife will give way if you take firm, aggressive action now. Just as a thunderstorm releases tensions in the atmosphere, it is time to clear the air of mistakes and resentments. This should be done decisively and without hesitation in an attempt to return the situation to normal as soon as possible. The timely execution of a LIBERATION from difficulty is essential to success.

The solutions to annoying political problems are no longer elusive. It is within your power now to resolve issues that have blocked your progress. Deal with them expediently. When it is possible to overlook past errors and forgive transgressions, do so, for the sooner the tensions are relieved, the better for all concerned. If you should find yourself in the midst of an intolerable situation or intrigue, then perhaps the time has come to depart from the situation entirely. Whatever course you take, act quickly. Do not linger in the difficulties. A timely LIBERATION from the stresses that occur in matters of power will bring good fortune.

Persons and problems that have consistently stood in the way of business endeavors can now be bypassed. Many of your past difficulties should resolve themselves with ease, providing you with a profound sense of relief. Let them go and do not seek retribution. Your concern should lie in returning your affairs to their regular and intended pattern.

Your relations with others should become less rigid as tensions are relieved and a refreshing sense of LIBERATION replaces anxieties. You may now successfully resolve complications brought about by adverse social arrangements. This should be done without delay and with no show of emotionalism. There is no reason to dwell petulantly upon the past or glory in your newfound LIBERATION. Do what you must quickly and quietly, and carry on with your affairs.

Times of tension and anxiety are passing in your personal relationships as well. Take this opportunity to put the past behind you. This LIBERATION from emotional complications and adversity can give you a fresh new start with your loved one. You may, in fact, find the present time unusually erotic.

When LIBERATION is complete, when the tensions of the storm have passed, your spirit will be refreshed and stimulated. The ground will be cleared for new growth, and the future will appear promising. And, once you finally dispense with emotional ruts or resentments from former times, you will have an excellent opportunity for personal advancement. Overall, you should feel increased energy and clarity in your dealings with the outside world.
