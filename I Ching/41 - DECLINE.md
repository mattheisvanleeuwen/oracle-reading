# CHAPTER 41: **DECLINE** (DECREASE) 

The pendulum swings once again. this time moving into a general DECLINE.Although the DECLINE points to the beginning of a later flowering, the way you handle this current decrease in resources is of great importance. This decrease is in accordance with the forces in the cosmos and therefore perfectly natural and completely unavoidable. You will ultimately benefit, however, from any sacrifices you must make now.

Accept the DECLINE and respond appropriately by simplifying your life. A sincere and simplified approach to life will prevent you from making serious mistakes with reality and will improve your sense of timing. If you find the DECLINE unacceptable and continue the pretense of more oppulent times, you will fall into error and out of touch

Simplicity at this time is genuinely good for your inner development. You must now alter certain attitudes by curbing your instincts and passionate drives. Even in your innermost Self you must economize in accordance with the current DECLINE of the life force. If you normally function with a great deal of tension, it is time to modify your behavior. Become conscious of any extravagant emotional reactions. By sacrificing any indulgences that occur at the instinct level, you can now benefit the higher aspects of your nature.

This work on the Self underlies the considerations in all worldly affairs. The DECLINE becomes evident in diminishing social contact. Again, you should not try to force events or carry on as though nothing had changed. Instead, turn your energies within and apply them to your personal aims. Success is yours through sincere devotion and simplicity.

In business affairs, the time will manifest most sharply in terms of material loss: loss of goods or wealth. Yet success in these matters is presaged if your attitude is confident and accepting, and if you attend to the business at hand. Remember, the time of sacrifice is transitional in nature. The pendulum continues to swing.

Personal relationships may now bring less excitement and pleasure than they have in the past. There may be less meaningful communication between you and yours, and a frustrating lack of information. Don't become angry or provocative in an attempt to rekindle passions. Instead, gear the relationship down to a simpler form more appropriate to the time of DECLINE. Be as reassuring as possible to those dear to you while devoting your energies to the refinement of your character.
