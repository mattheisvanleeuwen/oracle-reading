# CHAPTER 30: **SYNERGY (THE CLINGING)**

When two elements approach each other in such a way that the scope of what they can achieve together far surpasses the total of what they could achieve separately, they atw• acting with SYNERGY. SYNERGY, in this case, takes the effectiveness of cooperation beyond normal expectations.

This hexagram suggests that you and the object of your inquiry are dependent upon each other. Working together, the interaction of your spheres of influence can achieve significant deeds. These synergetic interactions will provide ideas and inspirations, generate surplus energy for continued growth, and refine communications and perceptions.

In worldly affairs, this is a time when a leader, dependent upon his principles and his sense of correctness, can bring enlightenment and order to those whom he leads. Here the SYNERGY between a leader and his integrity yields benefits to the people. The Chinese point out here: "Clarity of mind brought about by dependence on what is right can transform the world and perfect it."

In personal relationships you will find that the alignment of your desires can now achieve a great deal. This is a good time to examine your relationships and note whether you are working against one another or with SYNERGY. Co-operative efforts will not take energy away from individual pursuits. In fact, working relationships should now be especially supportive of individual achievements.

Keep in mind that as an individual your relationship with the cosmos is conditioned. By nature, the earth is a place of limitations — limitations of energy, of ideas, of resources, and even of the life force itself. The best way to achieve your aims within the limitations of your situation is to depend upon and synergize your energies with the forces of the cosmos. Learn to recognize the times, and act accordingly. When pressures mount, don't become explosive. Instead, work quietly and diligently to alleviate them. At times of high energy, don't throw yourself away in undisciplined euphoria. Work toward making the best use of the energy to enact new ideas and further your goals. When energies subside, use the time to rest and gather your strength instead of exhausting yourself with useless struggling. The development of SYNERGY within the Self will give you added dimensions of control over your future.
