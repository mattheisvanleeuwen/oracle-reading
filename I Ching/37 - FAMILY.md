# CHAPTER 37: **FAMILY**

In established families, the members adhere to their natural and comfortable roles. Their relations are based upon affection and upon a true sense of responsibility wherein the well-being of the FAMILY becomes as important as the pursuits of any one individual, The Chinese felt quite strongly about the value of this smallest of social units. They say of this hexagram: "Bring the family to its proper order and all social relationships will be correctly established."

When the roles between leaders and followers are understood and respected, then political situations become progressive. Leaders, like heads of families, must have inner strength and authority. They should be careful in their words and base their continuing credibility upon actions that demonstrate the soundness of their principles. Followers who defer to their leaders at this time can accomplish a great deal.

Business relationships should now be approached like FAMILY relationships. Such virtues as faithfulness, loyalty, and obedience can bring progress at any time, but never more so than now. Actions will speak louder than words, so don't waste time or money on rhetoric. Try to be consistent in your objectives and rely upon the guidance of authority to control the situation.

You can enrich your social relationships by adhering to roles based upon a natural affection and respect for others. Pretension, ostentation, and social climbing will work against you now. Your milieu demands enduring and consistent basic principles. You will be most successful if you fall back upon your true worth and conduct yourself with propriety. By persevering in established social customs you gain the support and loyalty of your society.

Rely upon your impulses and natural affections in personal relationships to suggest your true role. If you desire a traditional FAMILY relationship, then allow authority to be established and take your appropriate position. If there is a conflict of roles and your are not prepared to defer, then you may now run into severe problems. Your life will be significantly affected by the foundation provided in your FAMILY relationships.

Try to see all organizations, whether familial, social, or political, as FAMILY groups and then determine your most comfortable position within them. If you hold to this natural aspect of your character and understand the ensuing duties and responsibilities, you can more easily achieve your goals. Be certain, however, that you are not involved in carrying out a role for which you are unsuited, or a role that has been cast upon you. This will rob your life of meaning.
